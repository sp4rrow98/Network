### A Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users.

Using Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I implemented a social network that allows users to make posts, follow other users, and “like” posts. This web application follows the next requirements :
- **New Post**: Users who are signed in are able to write a new text-based post by filling in text into a text area and then clicking a button to submit the post.
- **All Posts**: The “All Posts” link in the navigation bar takes the user to a page where they can see all posts from all users, with the most recent posts first.
- **Profile Page**: Clicking on a username loads that user’s profile page
- **Following**: The “Following” link in the navigation bar takse the user to a page where they see all posts made by users that the current user follows.
 
- **Pagination**: On any page that displays posts, posts are displayed 10 on a page. If there are more than ten posts, a “Next” button appears to take the user to the next page of posts (which are older than the current page of posts). If not on the first page, a “Previous” button appears to take the user to the previous page of posts as well.
 
- **Edit Post**: Users are able to click an “Edit” button or link on any of their own posts to edit that post.
 
- **“Like” and “Unlike”**: Users should are able to click a button or link on any post to toggle whether or not they “like” that post.
